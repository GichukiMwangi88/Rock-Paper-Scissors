This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game from the Odin Project.
I created a simple UI where players can make selections. 
The player will be able to see their choice, computer choice and current scores.
The game announces winner after 5 rounds.
The game resets the scores back to zero after the fifth round.

This is my first project using JavaScript. Any code improvements are welcome. 
Thank you for visiting my github. 🧑🏿‍💻👍.
